# Pixel Art Vectorization for COMP 4102
Alexandra Wilson, Mitchell Blanchard, Nathan Marshall, and Megan Perera

# SUMMARY
Pixel art is difficult to upscale using traditional vectorization methods due to its small scale and the fact that each pixel is meaningful, as traditional vectorization methods rely on edge detection that fails in smaller sample sizes. This project seeks to implement and experiment with the algorithm for pixel art vectorization proposed by Kopf and Lischinski in the paper *Depixelizing Pixel Art (SIGGRAPH 2011)*. Challenges may include improving or developing new heuristics for pixel-art specific edge detection and/or optimizing the splines used to create smoother lines.
